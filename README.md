<h1>
  Background/Foreground Factorization for color video
</h1>

The source code provided is written for use in matlab. The code will work for only color videos. Arbitrary dimensions of the video frame are handled by the algorithm. The main component of the code uses the SVD of each color channel so larger video files may take longer to be decomposed.
